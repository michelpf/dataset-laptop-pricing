# Laptop Pricing Dataset

This dataset was originally downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anubhavgoyal10/laptop-prices-dataset).

The goal of this repository is to facilitate the teaching of Python classes with organized data.

This dataset is a collection of features related to various laptops, such as brand, processor type, RAM, storage capacity, and other specifications. The dataset also includes the corresponding prices of these laptops. This dataset can be used for regression analysis to predict the prices of laptops based on their features. The dataset is suitable for data scientists, machine learning enthusiasts, and researchers who are interested in building regression models to predict the prices of laptops based on various features.

This dataset was adapted for use in Machine Learning classes, replacing the currency to BRL using exchange rate of 05/2025.
